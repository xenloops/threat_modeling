# An Introduction to Threat Modeling
Duration: 45 minutes

<br /><br /><br />

### Description

What is threat modeling, and how do we do it without adding another burdensome security activity? This talk introduces threat modeling as a practice that reduces risk, saves effort, and enhances -- not blocks -- the software development process.

<br /><br /><br />

### About the speaker

Nathan Larson has led static analysis teams at two major financial institutions, pen-tested internet-connected industrial devices, performed code review in aerospace, and taught security and programming at the university and grad school levels. He has an MS in software engineering, a BS in computer science, and has held a few security certifications -- all of which show a proficiency in reading textbooks and passing exams. He wrote insecure code in several industries for two decades before catching the AppSec bug, from which he hasn't recovered in 10+ years. He currently creates threat models for client projects of all sizes.

### Key takeaways
Threat modeling:
* Helps teams better understand their systems and software projects.
* Shifts security earlier in the SDLC to save time, money, and frustration.
* Reduces security remediations later in the software development process.

### Ground rules
* Participation is good
* **Interrupt with questions!**
* There are no silver bullets in security
* Security is never 100%
