# The Art of Threat Modeling: an Introduction
Duration: 45 minutes

### About the speaker

Nathan Larson has led static analysis teams at two major financial institutions, pen-tested internet-connected industrial devices, performed code review in aerospace, and taught security and programming at the university and grad school levels. He has an MS in software engineering, a BS in computer science, and has held a few security certifications -- all of which show a proficiency in reading textbooks and passing exams. He wrote insecure code in several industries for two decades before catching the AppSec bug, from which he hasn't recovered in 10+ years. He currently creates threat models for client projects of all sizes.

### Ground rules
