# How to Threat Model

We already do a fair amount of threat modeling:

<br /><br />

**Asset:** House and possessions <br />
**Threat:** Fire <br />
**Control:** Maintain smoke detectors <br />

<br /><br /><br />

**Asset:** Vehicle <br />
**Threat:** Theft <br />
**Control:** Lock doors <br />
**Control:** Set alarm <br />
**Control:** Don't leave valuables in vehicle/plain sight <br />
**Control:** Drive a beater <br />

<br /><br /><br />

**Asset:** Foot <br />
**Threat:** Legos left on floor <br />
**Control:** Watch where you set foot down <br />
**Control:** Wear shoes in house <br />
**Control:** Train kids to clean up when they're done playing <br />

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


### Process

[Shostack's Four Question Framework](https://github.com/adamshostack/4QuestionFrame):

* What are we working on?
* What can go wrong?
* What are we going to do about it?
* Did we do a good enough job?

<br /><br />

The Electronic Frontier Foundation's five-question structure:

* What do you want to protect? (Data, communications, anything that could cause problems if misused.)
* Who do you want to protect it from? (Who might want the stuff?)
* How likely is it that you need to protect it? (Your level of exposure to the threats.)
* How bad are the consequences if you fail?
* How much trouble is protection worth? (Money, time, and effort you're willing to spend to protect this.)
