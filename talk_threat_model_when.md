# When do we do Threat Modeling?

<br /><br /><br />

* Ideally: begin as early as anyone is discussing the system
* When system architecture is coming together
* Anytime major changes are considered

<br /><br />

Do _not_ wait until:

* Architecture is set in stone
* Development is well underway
* The night before release

<br /><br />
