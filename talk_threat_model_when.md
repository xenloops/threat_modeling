# When do we do Threat Modeling?

* Ideally begin as early as anyone is discussing the system
* When system architecture is coming together
* Anytime major changes are considered

What? Yet Another Security Roadblock?

NO.

Threat Modeling is iterative
Fits into agile SDLC -- it's a living, breathing model
The Threat Model unfolds with implementation
Iterative refinement
	□ Always update when design changes to better reflect reality of the system.

<br /><br />

Do _not_ wait until:

* Architecture is set in stone
* Development is well underway
* The night before release

Waiting until after design is complete? We will not have a good day.
			□ Rework -- risk waivers -- exec signoffs
			□ "We're going 'live' tonight; can you 'bless' our security?"
