# When do we do Threat Modeling?

* Ideally begin as early as anyone is discussing the system
* When system architecture is coming together
* Anytime major changes are considered

* Fits into SDLC 
* Iterative; creates a living, breathing model
* Unfolds with implementation
* Allows for refinement


<br /><br />

Do _not_ wait until:

* Architecture is set in stone
* Development is well underway
* "We're going 'live' tonight; can you 'bless' our security?"

Waiting until after design is complete? We will not have a good day.
* Rework, risk waivers, exec signoffs
