* We look at a _model_ of the system
* More accurate models give more accurate results (GIGO)
* But we can threat model even with an incomplete design
* Doing anything is better than doing nothing

Threat modeling is a communal activity
* Best when it involves everyone:
  * Security experts
  * System architects
  * Development team
