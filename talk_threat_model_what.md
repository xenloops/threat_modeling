# What is Threat Modeling?

* An aspect of design
* A skillset to help guide design
* The process of finding defects in the security of the design of a system

### But Threat Modeling is _not_

* A "one and done" deliverable
* A data-flow diagram
* Investing in a tool
* Writing policy documents

Threat Modeling should not be used to reveal mysterious security issues that have a 0.0001% chance of happening. Alerting to real-world, common threats is much more useful.

to highlight concerns about security and privacy characteristics. </p>

## What does this mean?

* We look at a _model_ of the system
* More accurate models give more accurate results
* Can threat model even with an incomplete design
* Doing anything is better than doing nothing

## Why a _model_?

<br /><br />

<p align="center"><i>Ce qui est simple est toujours faux. Ce qui ne l’est pas est inutilisable.</i></p>
<p align="center">(If it's simple, it's always false. If it's not, it's unusable.)</p>

<br /><br />

In other words:

<p align="center">All models are wrong, but some are useful.</p>
<p align="right">Historic aphorism, as quoted by statistician George Box</p>

<br /><br />

* Waiting until every detail is set is counter-productive
* Threat modeling provides feedback to the design
* Threat modeling the actual system is penetration testing :P
