# What is Threat Modeling?

<br /><br /><br />

<p align="center"> Threat modeling is analyzing <i>representations</i> of a system <br>
to highlight concerns about security and privacy characteristics. </p>

<br /><br />

<p align="center"> At its heart, threat modeling is a collection of ways to anticipate and address problems. </p>

## What does this mean?

* We look at a _model_ of the system
* More accurate models give more accurate results
* Can threat model even with an incomplete design
* Doing anything is better than doing nothing

## Why a _model_?

<br /><br />

<p align="center"><i>Ce qui est simple est toujours faux. Ce qui ne l’est pas est inutilisable.</i></p>
<p align="center">(If it's simple, it's always false. If it's not, it's unusable.)</p>

<br /><br />

In other words:

<p align="center">All models are wrong, but some are useful.</p>
<p align="right">Historic aphorism, as quoted by statistician George Box</p>

<br /><br />

* Waiting until every detail is set is counter-productive
* Threat modeling provides feedback to the design
* Threat modeling the actual system is penetration testing :P
